You have read and watched every single video about "how to reach your goals," but still, you can't reach your goals for many reasons.

So I'm going to help you how **NOT** to reach your goals with these 6 ways.

# 1. Don't Be Specific
When setting an unreachable goal, don't be specific.

Being specific makes your goal clear and defined.

It's not our goal here!

# 2. Procrastinate
Procrastination has many negative effects.

It includes:

- keeping you from reaching your goals

- losing valuable time

- delays

- can damage mental health and so forth...

So I recommend keeping yourself always distracted and procrastinating more to avoid reaching your goal.

# 3. Just Think, Don't Act
If you keep thinking instead of acting towards your goals, then you're on the right track to not reaching your goal!

# 4. Don't Make a Progress (Even Little)
Ew! Progress! It's helping you reach your goal.

Even little progress can help you reach your goal.

It's best if you just sit around and do nothing.

# 5. Be a Pessimist
If you believe that you can't do it, then you're right.

Our mindset has a huge impact on us. Keeping a negative mindset is great when you don't want to reach your goal.

> “Mindsets are just beliefs. They're powerful beliefs, but they're just something in your mind, and you can change your mind.” - Dr. Carol Dweck

# 6. Don't Ask For Help
Be selfish. Don't ask for help.
